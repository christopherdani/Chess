# Chess
## A chess game project.

## Planned features:
1. Basic GUI
2. Basic AI for both black and white

## Issues:
1. There are smelly code that needs to be fixed.
2. Single Choice Principle violations.
3. Algorithm could be optimised.
4. Proper testing has yet to be done.
5. Overall design needs to be improved (as I started it with no plan in mind).
